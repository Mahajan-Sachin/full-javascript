//as name we use arrow the best thing is we can save the fn in a variable to
const sum=(a,b) =>{
    console.log(a+b);
}
sum(2,3);
console.log(sum)// it even prints all the theory part to show that a fn can be taken by a variable too

// we can use arrow without argument
const printhello=() =>{
    console.log("hello")
};
printhello()
