//array isa linear(like list) obj is like dictionary
//we can make array with diff data types but we not prefer it
let info=["rahul",56,"delhi"]

let marks=[10,20,68,99]
console.log(marks)
console.log(marks.length)
console.log(typeof marks)//prints objects bcoz java doesnot have array as its types but we consider it seprately
